# Generic Data Processing Pipeline

## Core Concept
A flexible, modular pipeline for processing any type of data through various stages:
1. Grab data from source
2. Process/transform it
3. Pass to next stage
4. Repeat as needed

## Core Goals
- Build a data processing pipeline.
- Allow easy addition of new processing stages

## Architecture
- Modular pipeline with pluggable stages
- Clear separation between data processing and API
- Each stage is independent and testable
- Easy to extend with new capabilities

## Key Technical Decisions
- Python as the core language
- Dataclasses for data models
- AI/LLM for intelligent processing
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Local LLM (llama2) for processing

## Pipeline Stages (Generic)
1. **Ingestion**: Get data from any source
2. **Processing**: Transform/enrich data
3. **AI/ML**: Apply intelligent processing
4. **Output**: Store/export results

## Data Flow
1. Source → Ingestion → Raw Data
2. Raw Data → Processing → Structured Data
3. Structured Data → AI/ML → Enriched Data
4. Enriched Data → Output → Final Result
